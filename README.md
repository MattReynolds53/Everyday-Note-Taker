# Note Taker Application

## Description
In this application, I have created a note tacker application by utilizing express. This webpage loads with a link to the note taer application. When the user clicks the link, he or she will be taken to an applicaiton that will allow him or her to create and save notes. When the user is done adding to the current note, he or she can click the save icon in the top right corner. This will save the note to the database, titled db.json, and will auto-populate the note in the column on the left side of the page. 

## Resources
This application requires express, and I utilized get, post, and delete requests in my code.
