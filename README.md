# Note Taker Application

## Description
In this application, I have created a note tacker application by utilizing express. This webpage loads with a link to the note taker application. When the user clicks the link, he or she will be taken to an applicaiton that will allow him or her to create and save notes. When the user is done adding to the current note, he or she can click the save icon in the top right corner that displays once the user has begun typing a note. This will save the note to the database, titled db.json, and will auto-populate the note in the column on the left side of the page. 

## Usage
This application requires express, and I utilized get, post, and delete requests in my code. When the user loads the code, he or she can enter "node server.js" into the terminal to start a server and view the deployed application. Alternatively, the user can open the application with the Heroku link.
